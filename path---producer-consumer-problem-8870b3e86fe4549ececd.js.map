So call <code>wait()</code> on condition instance to accomplish this.</li>\\n<li>This gives a chance to consumer to run. Consumer will consume data from queue which will create space in queue.</li>\\n<li>And then consumer should notify the producer.</li>\\n<li>Once consumer releases the lock, producer can acquire the lock and can add data to queue.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Final program looks like:</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>from threading import Thread, Condition\\nimport time\\nimport random\\n\\nqueue = []\\nMAX_NUM = 10\\ncondition = Condition()\\n\\nclass ProducerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        nums = range(5)\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            condition.`acquire()`\\n            if len(queue) == MAX_NUM:\\n                print \\\"Queue full, producer is waiting\\\"\\n                condition.wait()\\n                print \\\"Space in queue, Consumer notified the producer\\\"\\n            num = random.choice(nums)\\n            queue.append(num)\\n            print \\\"Produced\\\", num\\n            condition.`notify()`\\n            condition.`release()`\\n            time.sleep(random.random())\\n\\n\\nclass ConsumerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            condition.`acquire()`\\n            if not queue:\\n                print \\\"Nothing in queue, consumer is waiting\\\"\\n                condition.wait()\\n                print \\\"Producer added something to queue and notified the consumer\\\"\\n            num = queue.pop(0)\\n            print \\\"Consumed\\\", num\\n            condition.`notify()`\\n            condition.`release()`\\n            time.sleep(random.random())\\n\\n\\nProducerThread().start()\\nConsumerThread().start()</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Sample output:</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>Produced 0\\nConsumed 0\\nProduced 0\\nProduced 4\\nConsumed 0\\nConsumed 4\\nNothing in queue, consumer is waiting\\nProduced 4\\nProducer added something to queue and notified the consumer\\nConsumed 4\\nProduced 3\\nProduced 2\\nConsumed 3</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Implementation using Queue</h3>\\n<p>Let’s update our code to use Queue.</p>\\n<p>Queue encapsulates the behaviour of Condition, <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>, <code>acquire()</code> etc.</p>\\n<p>Now is a good time to read the <a href=\\\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/queue.html\\\">documentation for Queue</a> and the source code for it.</p>\\n<h3>Updated program:</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>from threading import Thread\\nimport time\\nimport random\\nfrom Queue import Queue\\n\\nqueue = Queue(10)\\n\\nclass ProducerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        nums = range(5)\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            num = random.choice(nums)\\n            queue.put(num)\\n            print \\\"Produced\\\", num\\n            time.sleep(random.random())\\n\\n\\nclass ConsumerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            num = queue.get()\\n            queue.task_done()\\n            print \\\"Consumed\\\", num\\n            time.sleep(random.random())\\n\\n\\nProducerThread().start()\\nConsumerThread().start()</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>In place of list, we are using a Queue instance(hereafter queue).</li>\\n<li>queue has a <strong>Condition</strong> and that condition has its lock.

So, they must use the same condition instance for the wait and notify functionality to work properly.</p>\\n<p><strong>Let’s rewrite our Consumer and Producer code:</strong></p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>from threading import Condition\\n\\ncondition = Condition()\\n\\nclass ConsumerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            condition.`acquire()`\\n            if not queue:\\n                print \\\"Nothing in queue, consumer is waiting\\\"\\n                condition.wait()\\n                print \\\"Producer added something to queue and notified the consumer\\\"\\n            num = queue.pop(0)\\n            print \\\"Consumed\\\", num \\n            condition.`release()`\\n            time.sleep(random.random())</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Let’s rewrite <strong>Producer code</strong>:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>class ProducerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        nums = range(5)\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            condition.`acquire()`\\n            num = random.choice(nums)\\n            queue.append(num)\\n            print \\\"Produced\\\", num \\n            condition.`notify()`\\n            condition.`release()`\\n            time.sleep(random.random())</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p><strong>Sample output:</strong></p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>Produced 3\\nConsumed 3\\nProduced 1\\nConsumed 1\\nProduced 4\\nConsumed 4\\nProduced 3\\nConsumed 3\\nNothing in queue, consumer is waiting\\nProduced 2\\nProducer added something to queue and notified the consumer\\nConsumed 2\\nNothing in queue, consumer is waiting\\nProduced 2\\nProducer added something to queue and notified the consumer\\nConsumed 2\\nNothing in queue, consumer is waiting\\nProduced 3\\nProducer added something to queue and notified the consumer\\nConsumed 3\\nProduced 4\\nConsumed 4\\nProduced 1\\nConsumed 1</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For consumer, we check if the queue is empty before consuming.</li>\\n<li>If yes then call wait() on condition instance.</li>\\n<li>wait() blocks the consumer and also releases the lock associated with the condition. This lock was held by consumer, so basically consumer loses hold of the lock.</li>\\n<li>Now unless consumer is notified, it will not run.</li>\\n<li>Producer can acquire the lock because lock was released by consumer.</li>\\n<li>Producer puts data in queue and calls <code>notify()</code> on the condition instance.</li>\\n<li>Once <code>notify()</code> call is made on condition, consumer wakes up. But waking up doesn’t mean it starts executing.</li>\\n<li><code>notify()</code> does not release the lock. Even after <code>notify()</code>, lock is still held by producer.</li>\\n<li>Producer explicitly releases the lock by using condition.<code>release()</code>.</li>\\n<li>And consumer starts running again. Now it will find data in queue and no IndexError will be raised.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Adding a max size on the queue</h2>\\n<p>Producer should not put data in the queue if the queue is full.</p>\\n<p>It can be accomplished in the following way:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Before putting data in queue, producer should check if the queue is full.</li>\\n<li>If not, producer can continue as usual.</li>\\n<li>If the queue is full, producer must wait. So call <code>wait()</code> on condition instance to accomplish this.</li>\\n<li>This gives a chance to consumer to run. Consumer will consume data from queue which will create space in queue.</li>\\n<li>And then consumer should notify the producer.</li>\\n<li>Once consumer releases the lock, producer can acquire the lock and can add data to queue.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Final program looks like:</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>from threading import Thread, Condition\\nimport time\\nimport random\\n\\nqueue = []\\nMAX_NUM = 10\\ncondition = Condition()\\n\\nclass ProducerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        nums = range(5)\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            condition.`acquire()`\\n            if len(queue) == MAX_NUM:\\n                print \\\"Queue full, producer is waiting\\\"\\n                condition.wait()\\n                print \\\"Space in queue, Consumer notified the producer\\\"\\n            num = random.choice(nums)\\n            queue.append(num)\\n            print \\\"Produced\\\", num\\n            condition.`notify()`\\n            condition.`release()`\\n            time.sleep(random.random())\\n\\n\\nclass ConsumerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            condition.`acquire()`\\n            if not queue:\\n                print \\\"Nothing in queue, consumer is waiting\\\"\\n                condition.wait()\\n                print \\\"Producer added something to queue and notified the consumer\\\"\\n            num = queue.pop(0)\\n            print \\\"Consumed\\\", num\\n            condition.`notify()`\\n            condition.`release()`\\n            time.sleep(random.random())\\n\\n\\nProducerThread().start()\\nConsumerThread().start()</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Sample output:</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>Produced 0\\nConsumed 0\\nProduced 0\\nProduced 4\\nConsumed 0\\nConsumed 4\\nNothing in queue, consumer is waiting\\nProduced 4\\nProducer added something to queue and notified the consumer\\nConsumed 4\\nProduced 3\\nProduced 2\\nConsumed 3</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Implementation using Queue</h3>\\n<p>Let’s update our code to use Queue.</p>\\n<p>Queue encapsulates the behaviour of Condition, <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>, <code>acquire()</code> etc.</p>\\n<p>Now is a good time to read the <a href=\\\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/queue.html\\\">documentation for Queue</a> and the source code for it.</p>\\n<h3>Updated program:</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>from threading import Thread\\nimport time\\nimport random\\nfrom Queue import Queue\\n\\nqueue = Queue(10)\\n\\nclass ProducerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        nums = range(5)\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            num = random.choice(nums)\\n            queue.put(num)\\n            print \\\"Produced\\\", num\\n            time.sleep(random.random())\\n\\n\\nclass ConsumerThread(Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        global queue\\n        while True:\\n            num = queue.get()\\n            queue.task_done()\\n            print \\\"Consumed\\\", num\\n            time.sleep(random.random())\\n\\n\\nProducerThread().start()\\nConsumerThread().start()</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>In place of list, we are using a Queue instance(hereafter queue).</li>\\n<li>queue has a <strong>Condition</strong> and that condition has its lock.
